              <p>Barak was born in Israel and grew up minutes away from extended family until he was eight. A long move to Pleasanton, CA, and a short move to Sunnyvale, CA later, Barak spent the next ten years playing soccer, learning piano, and stretching his creativity in woodworking. In college Barak learned Computer Science/Linguistics and was editor in chief of the school's satirical newspaper.</p>

              <p>Jen grew up in California (besides a woodsy stint in Pennsylvania) with a love of reading and outdoorsy family vacations. Jen dabbled in water polo, singing, and school plays. At university Jen studied Cognitive Science, was the graphics editor for the satirical newspaper, and ran enough laps around campus to complete a marathon with ease (and one with difficulty).</p>

            When Jen started at UCSD, the only people she knew happened to live in the same dorm suite as one Barak Tzori. Barak caught Jen’s attention when he played the French song Champs Elysees and when he drew semi-recognizable profiles of suite-mates without looking or lifting a pen. Barak and Jen went for dates around campus, and had their first kiss on a night hike on the edge of campus, where they spent the extra hour they had gained that night from Daylight Savings Time shivering on a hill that overlooked I-5 and thinking about this special moment in the context of hundreds of strangers zooming past.

            Fast-forward four years to graduation. Jen read Infinite Jest to impress Barak; Barak acquiesced to a date to the Fallen Star despite his fear of heights to impress Jen. Barak introduced Jen to his favorite movies; Jen introduced Barak to her favorite board games (now Barak’s favorite board games) and YA fiction books. Jen started learning Hebrew and Barak read Matthew, Mark, and Luke (John is a WIP).

            Post-graduation, Barak and Jen outfitted a minivan to accommodate a bed went on a 12,000-mile, 35-state (and 2-province) road trip around the U.S. and Canada in a for about two months (more of the story <a href="https://jenandbarakgoeverywhere.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">here</a>), visiting friends and family along the way and growing closer than ever – with such close quarters you’d have to!

            They returned to San Diego, CA where they both work as software engineers and spend free time playing music with friends and visiting local breweries. Jen continues to bake and read, while Barak exercises his creativity in woodworking and other projects.

            Barak proposed to Jen in their balcony garden on April 25th, with a ring in a box he had made and a beautiful speech about their love being like the growing garden. They can’t wait to spend the rest of their lives together!
